## Timing :hourglass:
When someone submits a pull request, we will have a designated person confirm the request and merge the branch.
THe flow will look like this: Andy -> Jacky -> Negar -> Khanh -> Andy. Andy will confirm Jacky's pull requests, Jacky will confirm Negar's and so on. Since only Andy and Negar are working on the same file (teamwork.md), we will allow Negar to work on half of the part first then merge it to prevent any issues.

Since we have designated people to confirm the request, we will mention them using the @mention feature shown below:
````
@Insert_Person
````

Here is a table summarizing if everyone managed to submit a pull request and confirm another persons pull request:

Member | Pull request | Confirm pull request
-------|--------------|---------------------
Andy| Done | Done
Jacky| Done | Done 
Negar| Done | Done 
Khanh| Done | Done

## Communication :speech_balloon:


Team 10 is communicating on Slack, we have our own private channel.

We will communicate logistics about meeting times and general deliverables. 

We will meet synchronously in person or on zoom to work on the projects, however some work will be done at our own time, where necessary.

Normally we will allow a day to respond to messages because our timelines are quite tight, (_except during weekends where we will give freedom to everyone to respond when they can_!) :chocolate_bar: :sunglasses:.

We will use GitHub Issues for our introductions.
