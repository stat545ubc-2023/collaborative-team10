## Timing :hourglass:




------
## Communication :speech_balloon:


Team 10 is communicating on Slack, we have our own private channel.

We will communicate logistics about meeting times and general deliverables. 

We will meet synchronously in person or on zoom to work on the projects, however some work will be done at our own time, where necessary.

Normally we will allow a day to respond to messages because our timelines are quite tight, (_except during weekends where we will give freedom to everyone to respond when they can_!) :chocolate_bar: :sunglasses:.

We will use GitHub Issues for our introductions.
